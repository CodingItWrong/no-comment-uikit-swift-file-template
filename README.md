# No Comment UIKit Swift File Template

A template to allow Xcode to generate a new Swift file saving two bits of work:

1. Removing the header comment, and
2. Importing from `UIKit` instead of from `Foundation`, as that's more common in iOS apps

## Installation

Clone this repo into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/MultiPlatform/Source` (creating any missing directories)

Then, when creating a new file in Xcode, you should see "No Comment UIKit Swift File" as the first option.
